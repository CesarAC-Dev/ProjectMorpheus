# Introduction 
Project Morpheus is a final year project developed jointly by two students. The aim of the project is to develop a puzzle-themed RPG video game for Android.

This video game consists of two parts, the story mode and the puzzle mode. The first tells the story of Arti, a boy who must enter the world of dreams while escaping from a nightmare. The second deals with the challenges to overcome during the adventure, these being different types of puzzles to solve.

The puzzle section has been developed by [CÃ©sar Ayuso](https://github.com/CesarAC-Dev), we have used Unity as development environment and C# as programming language.
